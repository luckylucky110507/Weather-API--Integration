##  WEATHER API INTEGRATION - TASK 1 (CODTECH INTERNSHIP)

This repository contains my **Task 1 project** for the codtech IT Solutions internship. The main objective of this task was to understand and implement **API integration**. For this purpose, I created a **Weather Application** that uses a public weather API to fetch and display real-time weather information. The project highlights the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and functional web application.

## Project Description

Weather plays a crucial role in our lives, and applications that provide accurate weather updates are used worldwide. The idea behind this project is to learn how to connect a web application with an external API and display live data in a simple and interactive way. By integrating a weather API, users can type a city name and intantly view the current temperature, weather condition, and an appropriate icon representing the climate.

This project demonstrates my understanding of **REST API calls**, **JavaScript Fetch API**, and **DOM manipulation**. When the user enters a city name, the app sends a request to the Wethaer API service. The service responds with JSON data containing weather details. JavaScript then extracts the relevant data and dynamically updates the webpage. To improve usability, the interface is designed with CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive across devices.

Through this task, I practiced real-world skills that are essential in modern web development. Most applications today require interaction with APIs-whether for weather, maps, payments, or authentication-and this project lays the foundation for such integrations.

## Technologies Used

**HTML**--: Provides the structure of the web page. 
**CSS**--: Adds styling, layout, and responsiveness.
**JavaScript**--: Handles API requests, processes data, and updates the UI dynamically.
**Weather API**: A public sewrvice that provides live weather data.

## Features

 - Real-time weather data fetching by city name.
 - Displays temperature, condition, and dynamic weather icons.
 - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
 - Error handling for invalid or empty city inputs.
 - Smooth and simple user experience.
